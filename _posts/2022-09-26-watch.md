Hi friends and welcome early arrivals to a new podcast about games in the roguelike genre!

If you're here, sit back, relax, and stay tuned for our first episode coming in a few days. We'll cover our podcast roadmap,
how we go about selecting games, our experiences with games in the roguelike genre, nerdy stats, and possible predictions to come. 

We hope you enjoy the podcast!
